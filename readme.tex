\begin{abstract}
This document describes the implementation of the simulation used in ``On informational nudging and control of payoff-based learning'' by R.Guers C. Langbort and D. Work, in the process of being submitted for publication in Automatica.
A preprint of the article is available for download on the second
author's website. The source code is hosted at \url{https://github.com/RobinGuers/On-Informational-Nudging-and-Control-of-a-payoff-learning-process}.

\section{Publishing results using this software}

We kindly ask any future publications using this software include
a reference to the following publication:

Guers Langbort and Work, ``On informational nudging and control of payoff-based learning''

\section{Structure of the code}
Below we give a description of scripts included in the software.
\begin{itemize}
\item \begin{verbatim}Plotl2R21Diagram.m\end{verbatim}
contains the implementation of the stability analysis presented in subsection 3-2 of the two alternative cases.
The functions
\begin{itemize}
\item \begin{verbatim}R21Critical1.m\end{verbatim} and
\item \begin{verbatim}R21Critical1.m\end{verbatim}
draw the upper and lower boundaries of the unstable region.
\end{itemize}


\item \begin{verbatim} MinimumLies2Alternatives.m\end{verbatim} is used to compute the minimum lies to nudge a user toward a specific equilibrium when the user faces two alternatives. It uses the functions
\begin{itemize}
\item \begin{verbatim}objToMinimize.m\end{verbatim} which returns a value measuring how far from equilibrium point the system is.
\end{itemize}


\item \begin{verbatim}DrawLieRegion.m\end{verbatim} can be used to visualize the admissible lying region for the case with three alternatives. It uses the function
\begin{itemize}
\item \begin{verbatim}plotregion.m \end{verbatim} available on Matlab exchange thanks to  Per Bergstr√∂m
\end{itemize}



\item \begin{verbatim}MinimumLies3Alternative.m\end{verbatim} is used to compute the minimum set of lies to nudge a user toward a specific equilibrium when the user faces three alternatives.
The functions used in this program are
\begin{itemize}
\item \begin{verbatim}PayoffToProbDeltaX.m\end{verbatim} which converts a payoff into a probability value using the logit rule.
\item \begin{verbatim}objfunDeltaX.m\end{verbatim} which returns a value measuring how far from equilibrium point the system is.
\end{itemize}


\item \begin{verbatim}AdaptiveConstantPayoff.m\end{verbatim} is used to simulate the discrete stochastic process presented in the section AdaptiveLyingStrategy.
The functions used are
\begin{itemize}
\item \begin{verbatim}AdaptiveLieDelta.m \end{verbatim} which computes the appropriate adaptive lie.
\item \begin{verbatim}InterestingQuantities.m \end{verbatim} which computes the quantity described in the proof of the adaptive lying strategy.
\end{itemize}
It also uses the classes
\begin{itemize}
\item \begin{verbatim} Player.m \end{verbatim} which contains the characteristic of a user and her ability to update and pick a choice at every time step.
\item \begin{verbatim} Network.m \end{verbatim} which encompasses more features than actually needed.
\end{itemize}


\end{itemize}
\section{Running the code}
The provided m-files can be used to reproduce the results presented in the publication.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Create the illustration of the stability region for section 3.2 by running the script\begin{verbatim}Plotl2R21Diagram.m\end{verbatim} where $\beta$ and the precision can be modified.

\item Draw the admissible lying region region for the case with three alternatives running the script
\begin{verbatim} DrawLieRegion.m\end{verbatim}.
The values of the logit parameter $\beta$, and the true reward R can be modified.
The default values are $\beta=1$ and R=[1,2,3].

 \item Generate the set of minimum constant lies for the case with two alternatives by running the script
 \begin{verbatim} MinimumLies2Alternatives.m\end{verbatim}.
The value of the logit parameter $\beta$, Pibegin,Piend and Pistep can be modified.
The default values are $\beta=1$, Pibegin=0.05, Piend=0.95 and Pistep=10.
 
 \item Generate the set of minimum lies for a specific true reward for the case with three alternatives by running the script
 \begin{verbatim}MinimumLies3Alternative.m \end{verbatim}.
The values of the logit parameter $\beta$,the true Reward R, PiMax, Pimin, NumPoint can be modified.
The default values are $\beta=1$, R=[1,2,3], PiMax=0.95, Pimin=0.05, NumPoint=5.
 
 \item Generate the simulation of the discrete stochastic process, by running
 \begin{verbatim}AdaptiveConstantPayoff.m\end{verbatim}
 where the true reward (GlobalPayofAv), the number of choice (ChoiceNumber), the number of different type of user (PlayerNumber), the number of step simulated, the desired payoff (xstar), the logit parameter $\beta$, and the averaging factors can be modified (the fast factor is 1/n and the slow one is $1/n^{1/2+\alpha}$. The default values are $\beta=1$, ChoiceNumber=3, PlayerNumber=5, StepNumber=100, xstar=[-1,0,1].
\end{enumerate}
